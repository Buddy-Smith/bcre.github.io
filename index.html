        <strong>Exciting potential contract with A2Z Security!</strong>  A2Z is a company working to expand their range of electronic products. We reached out in an email regarding how we could do business with A2Z. They were quick to respond with plenty of opportunities. They seem to be a company positioned to market and sell electronics but they also mentioned they could help us with the manufacturing process. They provided a clear list of developments and technologies they would like us to work on and even said they have funding prepared for some of the projects in mind. We’ll have more on this for anyone that will be with us in the next coming weeks.
